Hi, my name is Bisma, I am a passionate artist. I thoroughly enjoy the ability to be able to create my thoughts in a visual form. I think it's a very important learning style and something that should be implemented more in all industries. Art gives me the ability to visually express my feelings and thoughts and my emotions in a more acceptable form. Helping others better understand who I am. I am a Year Up student at Seattle Central College; this program bridges the gap for young people who may be lacking in opportunities or struggling in traditional academic structures to provide them with hands-on career-building opportunities. The Year Up motto is "High expectations and high support" and I have never seen such an incredible amount of support in any other structure. I am a dedicated and hard worker, I strive to live by my morals, values, and faith which keeps me in line with high expectations. An example of my work ethic is that I have worked retail for as long as I can remember and this has taught me the value of communication and how front-line jobs like these require an immense amount of strength and resilience. To be able to double even triple task and abide by certain rules all while making sure the customer is happy with little flexibility in your schedule. I hope to apply my creativity and the skills I acquire in Year Up and all my years in retail to be able to pursue a career as a UX/UI designer!
