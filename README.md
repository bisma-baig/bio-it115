Hi my name is Bisma, I am a passionate artist. I throughly enjoy the ability to be able to create my thoughts in a visual form. I Think its a very important learning style and something that should be implented more in all industuries. Art gives me the ability to express my feeling and thoughts visually but also my emotions in a more acceptable form. Helping others better undersand who I am. 
I am a Year Up student at Seattle Central College; this program abdidges the gap for young people who may be lacking in oppurtunies or struggling in traditional academic structures to provide them with hands on career building oppurtunities. The Year Up motto is "High expectations and high support" and I have never seen such incredible amount of support in any other structure. I am a dedicated and hard worker, I strive to live by my morals, values and faith which keeps me in line with high expectations. 
An example of my work ethic is that I have worked retail for as long as I can remember and this has taught me not only the value of communication but also how front line jobs like these, require an immense amount of strength and resliance. To be able to double even tripple task and abide by certain ruless all while making sure the customer is happy with little flexbility in your scheadule.I hope to apply my creativity and the skills I accquire in Year Up and all my years in retail to be able to pursue a career as a UX/UI designer!
